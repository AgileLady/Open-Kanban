Open Kanban
===========

Open Kanban - Open Source Initiative to create a Kanban core that is Lean and Agile.

Today, July 31, 2013 we start this project based on this post which describes the [meanings of Kanban](http://agilelion.com/agile-kanban-cafe/what-is-kanban), and the need for an Open Source based Kanban Agile and Lean method.

If you are interested in contributing to Open Kanban, please let us know emailing us at info at agilelion dot com.

Soon we will choose the best possible Open Source license and post the core of our early Open Kanban here. For now we have opted for LGPL 2.1.

Cheers,
